# Loki-s-Cheat-Sheet-Program-Holder-
This is just a simple crude program I made to help workflow (specifically .apk modding and reverse engineering) I'm a fairly new programmer so everything might not be implemented correctly but it works to serve its purpose, I chose to leave this open source so you can change the embedded button/exe programs to your liking or whatever. if you remake this just give credit yea? this might be easy for some to make but being new to programming I struggled a bit, but I am proud and am still improving and learned quite a bit making this. I will probably build on this while trying to better my craft so if anyone has any ideas to make this better or better ways I could code certain things, I take constructive criticism rather well so just let me know. hope you all enjoy my first git XD






Version 1.0 Features : 

~ Log up to 12 different programs to a quick access dock

~ "Always on top" radio button for easy accessability

~  quick access to your Systems build in Calculator, Notepad, and File explorer

~ Quick link buttons to CodeBeautify.org and CE Wiki (Cheat Engine)

~ save button to log your programs

~ open button to access your saved configuration

~ clear all button


KNOWN ISSUES:

There are a couple executables ive had trouble getting to run but I think that has to do with adding an acception for different file extentions.
look forward to that being resolves as well as an implemented feature to clear out and modify each button at once,
rather than clearing out the whole table to make program changes. All suggestions are welcomed.
